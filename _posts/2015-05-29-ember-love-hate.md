My relationship with Ember began back in the summer of 2013. At the time, I was
spending a lot of time with Ruby on Rails, but there was something missing. I
was constantly needing to write more and more javascript to deliver rich
experiences for web applications, so I was on the lookout for a javascript
framework to help manage that code. Then, I met Ember.js and it was love at
first site.

Below are a couple of reasons why I love Ember:

####The Community

I have been working in the software industry since 1999. The journey so far has
allowed me to interact with communities in Java, C#, PHP, and Rails in a
developer capacity. I never had issue with any of those communities, but I
didn't realize how much was missing until I started interacting with the Ember
community. It's possible that there is a benefit to joining a technical
community in its early stages, so we will see, but the Ember community is
second to none at this time.

Attend any meetup, conference or industry related event and you will find nice
people willing to talk about and share what they are doing in Ember, what
struggles they have, and their knowledge. The same goes for the Ember online
communities such as [Ember Discuss](http://discuss.emberjs.com/), the Ember
IRC channels, and
[Ember Community Slack Organization](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

Since my relationship began with Ember, I have had the opportunity to meet a lot
of people for the first time and every interaction turned into a ray of light
for that day. Everyone is genuinely nice. People matter in technology, more than
the code does.

Here is a short subset of twitter handles for people that I have met
since first jumping into Ember: @sugarpirate_, @FaizaanShamsi, @joostdvrs,
@rwjblue, @jerelunruh, @hchood, @tehviking, @HeroicEric, @eaf4,
@bcardarella & @dockyard team, @machty, @stefanpenner, @searls, @codeofficer,
@lukemelia, @stevekinney, @tomdale, @ebryn, @samselikoff
I put this list together quickly, so apologies to those I missed. You're all
awesome. If you are new to Ember, check out who these people have following them
and who they are following.

####Productivity is High. . .After the Learning Curve

The best part and the worst part about Ember is convention over configuration.
What that means is that Ember does not try to provide multiple different ways to
solve front end development problems, the framework has a chosen way to
accomplish different front end development tasks. 



####Convention over Configuration
 is better for me - I struggle with making decisions when I have too many options

As with all long term relationships, it's not all blue skies and sunshine. There
are some things lacking, but they should get better over the long term.

Hate
####keeping up with change is time consuming, but is required to keep productivity high

####docs are hard to keep up to date because change happens so often

####let’s face it, learning javascript is hard enough and keeping up with javascript changes also has it’s challenges

I love Ember and am excited about my future with Ember. There are a lot of
challenges in loving Ember, but the positives far outweigh the negatives and
the community is doing a great job of negating the challenges in place.

Maybe this is what Rails felt like at first. I wasn’t there, but I hope the velocity of change slows
